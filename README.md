# hello-world
This is part of the tutorial for Github.  There was a missing period in the first sentence, after the word Github.  

I am finally going to do this a lot more for many different kinds of projects.  There are many places to do this, and maybe a good place to start will be with, for example, Robot Framework.  I think I can find many good places to improve Robot Framework!  

This can also be used for other things, like understanding exactly what is happening with commits and branches.  This is starting to make more sense. I still need to practice as much as possible to get all this terminology down, that is, stuff I should have learned probably a long time ago.
